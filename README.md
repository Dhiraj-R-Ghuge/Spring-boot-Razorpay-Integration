Spring Boot Payment Integration System
• Developed a Spring Boot–based Payment Integration System using a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository, DTO). Implemented REST APIs to create and validate payment orders, handle callbacks, and manage transaction flow. Used Razorpay’s pre-built JavaScript functions inside simple frontend files (index.html, success.html) to open the payment interface, with the frontend acting only as a trigger/view while all core logic and processing were handled in the backend.
